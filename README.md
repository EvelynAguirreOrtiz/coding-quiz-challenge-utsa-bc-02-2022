# Coding Quiz
## Module 4 Challenge

### Purpose

This is a timed code multiple-choice coding quiz that runs in a browser.

The quiz begins once the start button is clicked. The countdown timer is set for 60 seconds.

There is a short series of four questions with four possible answers. Ten points are awarded for each correct answer, while 10 seconds are deducted for each incorrect answer.

If the timer reaches 0, the user is notified that the time is up. If the user answers all four questions within the time allowed, then they are congratulated on finishing the quiz.

At the end of the game, the user should be able to save their high score and initials, but that part os the code is not yet functional.
